                <p>Visconnect is a framework for adding p2p synchnronous collaberation to new or existing web based visualizations. 
                  Events, such as clicking, dragging, and brushing, are synchronized across collaborators. 
                  Visconnect also supports synchnronization of custom events to enable custom collaberative interactions.</p>

This research has thrived over the past years with multiple workshops, seminars, and a growing body of publications, spanning several conferences. Given the rapid advancement of interaction technologies and novel application domains, this paper aims toward a broader research agenda to enable widespread adoption. We present 17 key research challenges developed over multiple sessions by a diverse group of 24 international experts, initiated from a virtual scientific workshop at ACM CHI 2020. These challenges aim to coordinate future work by providing a systematic roadmap of current directions and impending hurdles to facilitate productive and effective applications for Immersive Analytics.},

In this paper, we explore how current risk detection systems have allowed attackers to take advantage of design oversights and target vulnerable users with photosensitivity on popular social media platforms. Through interviews with photosensitive individuals and a critical review of existing systems, we constructed design requirements for consumer-driven protective systems and developed a prototype browser extension for actively detecting and disarming potentially seizure-inducing GIFs and videos. We validate our system with a comprehensive dataset of simulated GIFs and GIFs collected from social media. Finally, we conduct a novel quantitative analysis of the prevalence of seizure-inducing GIFs across popular social media platforms and contribute recommendations for improving online accessibility for individuals with photosensitivity.

              abstract = {Background Personalized medicine promises individualized disease prediction and treatment. The convergence of machine learning (ML) and available multi-modal data is key moving forward. We build upon previous work to deliver multi-modal predictions of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease (PD).Methods We performed automated ML on multi-modal data from the Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD.Findings Our initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72\% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03\%). Optimizing thresholds for classification, increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy (balanced accuracy) and other metrics. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT was the largest contributing predictor for the classification of PD. The transcriptomic data was used to construct a network of disease-relevant transcripts.Interpretation We have built a model using an automated ML pipeline to make improved multi-omic predictions of PD. The model developed improves disease risk prediction, a critical step for better assessment of PD risk. We constructed gene expression networks for the next generation of genomics-derived interventions. Our automated ML approach allows complex predictive models to be reproducible and accessible to the community.Funding National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Global Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Genetics Program.Evidence before this study Prior research into predictors of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) has either used basic statistical methods to make predictions across data modalities, or they have focused on a single data type or biomarker model. We have done this using an open-source automated machine learning (ML) framework on extensive multi-modal data, which we believe yields robust and reproducible results. We consider this the first true multi-modality ML study of PD risk classification.Added value of this study We used a variety of linear, non-linear, kernel, neural networks, and ensemble ML algorithms to generate an accurate classification of both cases and controls in independent datasets using data that is not involved in PD diagnosis itself at study recruitment. The model built in this paper significantly improves upon our previous models that used the entire training dataset in previous work1. Building on this earlier work, we showed that the PD diagnosis can be refined using improved algorithmic classification tools that may yield potential biological insights. We have taken careful consideration to develop and validate this model using public controlled-access datasets and an open-source ML framework to allow for reproducible and transparent results.Implications of all available evidence Training, validating, and tuning a diagnostic algorithm for PD will allow us to augment clinical diagnoses or risk assessments with less need for complex and expensive exams. Going forward, these models can be built on remote or asynchronously collected data which may be important in a growing telemedicine paradigm. More refined diagnostics will also increase clinical trial efficiency by potentially refining phenotyping and predicting onset, allowing providers to identify potential cases earlier. Early detection could lead to improved treatment response and higher efficacy. Finally, as part of our workflow, we built new networks representing communities of genes correlated in PD cases in a hypothesis-free manner, showing how new and existing genes may be connected and highlighting therapeutic opportunities.Competing Interest StatementHL, HI, FF, DV, YS, and MAN declare that they are consultants employed by Data Tecnica International, whose participation in this is part of a consulting agreement between the US National Institutes of Health and said company.
